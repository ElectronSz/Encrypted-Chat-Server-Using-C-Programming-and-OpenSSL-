# Encrypted-Chat-Server-Using-C-Programming-and-OpenSSL-AES-DES

This is a client - server user-level application using sockets Programming in C. Server accepts strings from client and can reply to client. Both server and client(s) output's of chat shows on terminal.The server and client processes can run on same or different machines. Server and client connection is encrypted, send and receive messages can't be traced by any intruder as we are using OpenSSL certificates for encryption. In this post only we will have a brief overview of creating Openssl certificates using OpenSSL tool.

 > Various Features Included  :

    * Usage of Socket Programming for creating Client & Server program
    * Multi-threading for Full Duplex Communication between Client and Server
    * Encrypted Communication between Client and Server 
    * Usage of Basic Networking Concepts & Linux Os for executing client and server programs


> Future Improvements :

    - Accept multiple Clients 
    - Create Chat Logs between client and server
    - Add file transfer + Video conferencing (need to use Java | Python programming)
    - Using C graphics library add GUI (graphics user interface)
    - Name and rename users | Block clients
